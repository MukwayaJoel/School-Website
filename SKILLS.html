<h3 id="visual">VISUAL</h3>
<p>It is said that videos and images are directly processed by long-term memory. When concepts are paired with related images, infographics, or videos, learners retain a greater percentage compared to just text or audio; it accelerates the learning process and increases retention dramatically.</p>

<h3 id="auditory">AUDITORY</h3>
<p>Possible uses for auditory learners include listening to podcasts and audio books, and using an app called Me Books (pointed out by Melissa Lawrence at learnsafe.com) that lets young students listen to stories and record themselves reading</p>

<h3 id="kinesthetic">KINESTHETIC</h3>
<p>Asking students to create videos can help encourage kinesthetic learners to incorporate physical action to the information they are learning, thus helping them retain it. For example, you could ask students to keep a video blog or make videos of themselves performing a task related to the course material (Kato, 2017).</p>

<h3 id="extra research">EXTRA RESEARCH</h3>
<p>When I started my Ph.D., I knew I would be introduced to many new things. I knew the courses would be challenging and that I would have to do a lot of research and writing. However, I did not have much knowledge about one very important topic: academic publishing. I knew I could get advice from my professors and advisors. However, I decided to do some research on my own because I knew this would give me an edge as I continue my studies. This is how I came across the e-learning platforms and wondered how they work.</p>

<h3 id="boosts the IQ">BOOSTS THE IQ</h3>
<p>The influence of online classes on work stress, burnout, and performance can be moderated by EI, but little existing research has observed direct and indirect impacts among these variables. The present study aimed to investigate the influence of e-learning (online classes) on work stress, burnout, and performance, and the potential moderation of EI of these effects. This research is based on emotion regulation theory (Gross, 1998), indicating that individuals assess the understanding, valence, and value relevance to control their feelings and emotions according to the existing situation. A person who possesses high emotional competencies is better tends to execute his or her skill (Kirk et al., 2008). A very valuable mechanism by which negative outcomes of sentiments can be coped is EI. Goleman (2001) recommended that individuals who possess strong social awareness are better at minimizing the destructive consequences of sentiments, and their overall performance also increased substantially. Garg et al. (2016) found that EI was directly related to adjustment to existing situations, and adjustment was directly connected to overall performance.</p>
