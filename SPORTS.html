<p>Football is the national sport in Uganda. The Uganda national football team, nicknamed 
The Cranes,is the national team of Uganda and is controlled by the Federation of Uganda Football Associations.</p>
Games are central to the Naalya curriculum not just because students enjoy them, 
but because they embody many qualities in which the schools believe. 
Learning to win and lose, to lead and be led, to push oneself to and perhaps beyond one’s limits, 
to think as part of a team, to know when to strive for more and when to acknowledge defeat; 
these are all an important part of learning to succeed in life. 
Consequently, Naalya aims to give every student the chance to benefit from learning through sport by playing and being taught the sport of their choice at the level appropriate to their abilities and interest.
There is a vast range of sports available, such as football
