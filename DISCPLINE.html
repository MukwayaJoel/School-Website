<strong>Suspension</strong>

<img src="img/yr.jpg" alt="ABOUT US">
<p>Court in Kampala has declined to halt the indefinite suspension meted against a Senior Six student of St Peter’s Senior Secondary School, Naalya, who had been accused of distributing cookies with cannabis, 
commonly known as marijuana, to fellow learners.
Tracy Bamanya Natukunda, presiding judge Musa Ssekaana yesterday held that the learner’s presence is a threat to other students.
The school should be given a benefit of doubt in exercise of its disciplinary powers against the student until the court finds otherwise. The rights of the applicant (student) against the entire school community should be a factor to consider and the likely danger of the applicant returning to the school and the entire school atmosphere in such circumstances,” 
ruled Justice Ssekaana yesterday.
